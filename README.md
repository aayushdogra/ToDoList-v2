# ToDoList-v2
Upgraded my ToDoList-v1 by adding database to it. Now we can add data, delete data and store data. Used MongoDB and Mongoose for DB Functionality and Heroku for server functionality.

// For Local Machine
Now we can create custom ToDoList by just simply adding the title in the URL, i.e https://localhost:3000/CustomName/
Just add the custom list name in place of "CustomName" in the URL.

Add items by using + button.
Delete the item from the list by just checking the checkbox.
